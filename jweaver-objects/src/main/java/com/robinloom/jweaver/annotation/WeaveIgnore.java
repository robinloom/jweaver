/**
 * Excludes a field, method, or record component from being rendered by JWeaver.
 * <p>
 * Use {@code @WeaveIgnore} to suppress properties that are not relevant for
 * textual output or that would otherwise clutter the rendered representation.
 * This annotation is evaluated by all {@link com.robinloom.jweaver.commons.Weaver}
 * implementations and takes precedence over other weave-related annotations.
 * <p>
 * Typical examples include internal caches, derived values, or references that
 * would cause redundant output.
